# Heartbeat Clustering 🫀

Welcome to the **Heartbeat Clustering** project! This project focuses on clustering heart signal patterns using unsupervised learning techniques to group heartbeats with similar patterns. By leveraging **K-means clustering**, the project seeks to provide insights into heartbeat signal patterns, which can assist in detecting anomalies early and improving patient monitoring systems.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **cluster heart signals** based on their similarities. Heart signal data, such as those from an Electrocardiogram (ECG), can reveal a lot about a person's heart health. By clustering these signals, we can identify common patterns and anomalies. This information can then be used for early detection of irregularities and to develop more effective monitoring systems for patients.

### Key Objectives:
- **Clustering Heart Signals**: Using K-means clustering to group heart signals based on similarity.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying abnormal patterns in the heart signal clusters, which can help in early detection of heart-related issues.
- **Insights for Medical Monitoring**: Provide meaningful insights into patient heart health by observing clustered heart signal patterns.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The project begins by collecting heart signal data, usually in the form of ECG signals, which provide detailed information about the heart's activity.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and standardize the signals.
3. **Clustering with K-means**: The **K-means algorithm** is applied to cluster similar heartbeats into groups. This helps identify patterns in the heart signals.
4. **Analysis**: The clusters are analyzed to understand common heart signal patterns and identify anomalies.
5. **Visualization**: The clusters are visualized for better understanding, providing insights into healthy and abnormal heart patterns.

## 📊 Techniques Used

- **K-means Clustering**: This unsupervised learning algorithm is used to classify heart signals based on similarities. The number of clusters is predefined, and the algorithm groups the data into these clusters iteratively.
- **Anomaly Detection**: By examining the clustered signals, we can identify outliers or anomalies, which may indicate potential health risks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as normalization and noise reduction are used to ensure the signals are clean and consistent for clustering.

## 📊 Results

### Anomaly Detection

By analyzing the clusters, we can identify anomalies, which are heart signal patterns that don't fit well into the existing clusters. This can help in detecting potential health issues earlier:

- **Cluster 1**: Regular heartbeat patterns
- **Cluster 2**: Irregular or abnormal heartbeat patterns (potential anomalies)

### Insights from Clustering

The clustering reveals specific patterns in heart signals, such as regular beats and irregularities that may indicate underlying health conditions.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

While the current model works well for basic clustering, several improvements can be made:

- **Deep Learning**: Implementing deep learning techniques, such as autoencoders, to improve clustering accuracy.
- **Dynamic Clustering**: Exploring dynamic clustering algorithms that can adapt to changing data patterns over time.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrating this clustering technique into real-time heart monitoring systems to provide early alerts for potential heart issues.
- **More Data**: Using larger, more diverse datasets to improve the robustness and generalization of the clustering model.
